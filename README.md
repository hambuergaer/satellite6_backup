# Satellite 6 backup script
This script creates a Satellite backup in offline mode. This means that the Satellite services are unavailable during the backup process. This ensures a consistent backup of your data. Please keep this in mind and schedule your Satellite backup at a time where Satellite service unavailability is not a problem. Use this script on your own risk!!! I don't guarantee for any functionalities. Please test this script in a proper test environment first if you are unsure of using this script.
